##### The prayer above contains the following four reflections:

**Loving-kindness:** is active good will towards all;  
**Compassion:** results from metta (loving kindness ), it is identifying the suffering of others as one's own;  
**Empathetic joy:** is the feeling of joy because others are happy, even if one did not contribute to it, it is a form of sympathetic joy;  
**Equanimity:** is even-mindedness and serenity, treating everyone impartially.
